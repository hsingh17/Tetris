# Tetris
Tetris recreation in C++ using the SFML library.

# Motivation
I really enjoy playing Tetris, and I have always wanted to recreate this classic arcade game for my own. I finally found some time, so I finally decided to sit down and recreate Tetris. Through this project, I expanded my knowledge of C++ libraries by using SFML for the GUI.

# Installation 
I have not included a guide to installing and running the source code, as when I installed SFML initally, I ran into some problems of my own, so the directions I provide here may not apply to all OS. A detailed guide is provided on the [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). If you run into problems during the installation process, consult the forum. I have included an executable if you would like to play the game.

# Mechanics
I tried my best to recreate a genuine experience of Tetris, here are some of the features/controls:
1. `Space` is to hard drop a piece
2. &#8593; is to rotate a piece 90 degrees clockwise
3. &#8592; & &#8594; is to move the piece left and right, respectively
4. 'R' is to restart the game after a game over
5. This recreation has the Tetris mechanic known as [Infinity](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity)
6. This recreation uses the [Sega Rotation System](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Sega_Rotation)

# Contribution/Critique
I have not implented hold functionality, nor have I implemented next piece showing, if you would like to add these features or use my Tetris recreation as a base for something else be my guest. Also, please give any critique to the code, as I always try to find ways to get better.
